# Create-Users-From-List
Here's how you can use this script:

<ul>
<li>Save the script to a file, e.g. create_users.sh.</li>
<li>Make the file executable: chmod +x create_users.sh</li>
<li>Create a file containing a list of usernames, one per line, e.g. usernames.txt.</li>
<li>Run the script with the filename as an argument: ./create_users.sh usernames.txt</li>
</ul/
<p>The script will create a new user account for each line in the file usernames.txt.
Note that the script assumes that the usernames in the file do not contain any spaces or special characters.
If your usernames do contain spaces or special characters, you may need to modify the script to handle them correctly.
