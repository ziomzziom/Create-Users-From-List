# Create-Users-From-List
Here's how you can use this script:

<ul>
<li>Create a file called usernames.txt with a list of usernames you want to create:</li>
<li>Save the create_users.sh script to a file.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are located.</li>
<li>Make the create_users.sh script executable by running the command:</li>
<li>Run the script with the usernames.txt file as an argument by running the command:</li>
</ul>
<p>The script will create a new user account for each line in the file usernames.txt.
Note that the script assumes that the usernames in the file do not contain any spaces or special characters.
If your usernames do contain spaces or special characters, you may need to modify the script to handle them correctly.
